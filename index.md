## Usage
	 Whilst we hope it is easy to use the app without any prior instruction, below is a detailed breakdown of the different user interfaces.
	
**Menu**
	In the menu, select the limitations for your session: the number of sets, the duration of your work intervals, and the duration of your rest intervals. Note that these are unlimited by default and cannot be zero (unlimited is delimited by the infinity ∞ symbol). The number of intervals is capped at 100, and both work and rest durations are capped at three minutes.

	To change theses parameters, either tap on the values for keyboard input, or drag to rotate the three wheels and increment the values. These wheels will light up when pressed.

For advice on structuring your workouts with Botech Interval Timer, scroll down to the ‘Inspiration’ section.

Whilst using the app, at any time you may toggle between light and dark mode using the button located at the top of the screen.

When you are happy with your selection, press the continue button.
	
**Timer**
After a five second countdown, you will see two circular clocks: the smaller clock indicates your session progress, and the larger indicates your interval progress. Depending on your session parameters, these clocks will show different things. 

If your session has limited sets, it will display the number of sets you have completed, next to the number of sets you have specified for the session. Otherwise, if unlimited, it will display the number of sets completed.

If your work or rest is limited, your interval clock will show the time remaining of that interval and a labelled button indicating the type of interval: either work or rest. Otherwise it will indicate the elapsed time. Note that the work/rest button may be pressed at any time and will end the current interval (this will skip the remainder of the current interval if the time is limited).

When your session has finished, or you wish to end the session, swipe right.

**Report**
The report is visually similar to the menu. It shows three labelled values, the number of sets completed, the total elapsed time, and the time worked (which does not include the rest time).

To restart, press the restart button on the bottom left of the screen. Otherwise, dismiss the app as you would any other.
