## Usage
Whilst we hope it is easy to use the app without any prior instruction, below is a detailed breakdown of the different user interfaces.

In the menu, select the limitations for your session: the number of sets, the duration of your work intervals, and the duration of your rest intervals. Note that these are unlimited by default and cannot be zero (unlimited is delimited by the infinity ∞ symbol). The number of intervals is capped at 20, and both work and rest durations are capped at a minute. To change these values, drag the slider right to increase its value and left to decrease it. For advice on structuring your workouts with Botech Interval Timer, scroll down to the ‘Inspiration’ section. When you are happy with your selection, press the continue button.

After a five second countdown, your workout has begun! You will see two circular clocks: the smaller clock indicates your session progress, and the larger indicates your interval progress. Depending on your session parameters, these clocks will show different things. If your session has limited sets, it will display the number of sets you have completed, next to the number of sets you have specified for the session. Otherwise, if unlimited, it will display the number of sets completed.

If your work or rest is limited, your interval clock will show the time remaining of that interval and a labelled button indicating the type of interval: either work or rest. Otherwise it will indicate the elapsed time. Note that the work/rest button may be pressed at any time and will end the current interval (this will skip the remainder of the current interval if the time is limited).

When your session has finished, or you wish to end the session prematurely, swipe left anywhere on the screen. If you have to pause or unpause the timer at any point you can do so by tapping anywhere on the background.

The report is visually similar to the menu. It shows three labelled values, the number of sets completed, the total elapsed time, and the time worked (which does not include the rest time).

To restart, press the restart button on the bottom left of the screen. Otherwise, dismiss the app as you would any other.

## Inspiration

**HIIT & Tabata**
High intensity interval training is an increasingly popular training technique that would be perfectly suited to Botech Interval Timer. One of the most popular interval training techniques, named after Izumi Tabata's 1996 Paper, specifies 8 sets of 20 seconds of work, followed by 10 seconds of rest. You could use a spinning bike or any bodyweight cardiovascular exercise such as burpees or sprints to perform your 20 seconds of work. Interval training twice to three times per week is proven to be more effective at increasing your VO2max than long duration-low intensity work (Helgerud et al, 2007).

**Strength & Hypertrophy**
Botech Interval Timer is also designed to supplement weight and resistance training. If you are training with the aim of growing muscle mass you should be monitoring your rest intervals. Studies indicate that resting between 30 seconds to a minute is the optimal duration for muscular hypertrophy (de Salles et al, 2009).

**Stretching & Yoga**
Botech Interval Timer is also suited to stucture stretching sessions and to practice holding static positions. To add intesity to an existing yoga regime, time your positions and regulate the time you spend between movements using this app.
